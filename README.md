# Hi there, I'm Prebh Dev Singh 👋

## About Me

I'm a **Product Manager** specializing in **Cybersecurity**, with a focus on AI-powered threat detection and enterprise security solutions.

As **CEO of Khalis Foundation**, I've spent over 23 years leveraging technology to serve communities, combining operational excellence with purpose-driven leadership. This dual experience—building enterprise products and scaling nonprofit operations—has shaped my approach to problem-solving: empathetic, strategic, and execution-focused.
